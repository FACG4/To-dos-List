### 1.Why?
an application that provides simple features to help users to organize their tasks, they can add, Edit, mark and delete it.
Else to apply what we have learned last two weeks,
DOM , Testing , HTML, JavaScript , CSS.


### 2.What?
single web-page that contained form to insert the tasks and give them priorities , else the user can edit mark and delete the select his tasks .


### 3.How?
* At the beginning we skitch our page .
* We all agreed about how we should start the project .  
* Front-end
* Functions [pure functions , Dom functions] :
[add , delete , mark , edit] ..
* Test for every single pure function
* Everyone of us has taken a single function [ built , test ] .
* Then we joined the pure function with the DOM .
* Fixed the conflicts .
* Push the tasks and merged it .
